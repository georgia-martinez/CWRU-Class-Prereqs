Students must understand these implications to successfully navigate the world of public company financial reporting.  One implication is the role SOX gave to corporate board audit committees to oversee the independent auditors charged with auditing public company financial statements.

Another implication is the establishment of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to regulate the accounting profession.

    "description": "Race and Racism will discuss the classical and contemporary understandings of the concepts of race and racism. We will begin by taking an historical approach, delving into processes of racialization and the first instances where distinctions in human race were noted. We will survey theories of race and use a social constructions approach to examine how sociologists approach the study of racial and ethnic group difference. We will examine how definitions of racial groups have evolved over time and differ across contexts, as well as some of the underlying social and structural processes that create racial hierarchies. At the end of the course students should have a strong understanding of the mechanisms that reproduce systems of racial classification. The course will also examine patterns and trends in racial and ethnic inequality over recent decades, centering our discussion on the legacies of racism, current discrimination, and new processes that are currently unfolding to reproduce inequality.While the course's main focus is to examine understandings of race and racism in the United States, we will devote some attention to how race and ethnicity emerge in different environments by examining race and racism in an international context.Offered as AFST 386, SOCI 386 and SOCI 486.

It differs from most traditional anatomy courses not only in its use of three-dimensional imaging technologies but also in its systemic rather than regional approach; the structure of the human body is learned by studying organ systems (e.g., the nervous system, the musculoskeletal system) rather than focusing on one region at a time (e.g., the thorax or the lower limb). This approach gives students the \"big picture\" of how the human body is organized, thereby providing a solid foundation for other courses that deal with the anatomy of the human body in greater detail. Cadaver demonstrations allow students to see anatomical systems in context and apply knowledge learned through virtual technologies. This course is presented in a blended format. Weekly one-hour framing lectures by Anatomy faculty will be pre-recorded and available for asynchronous viewing prior to the start of each week. In-person lab sessions will take place on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays, with one-third of the class participating in each of three activities each day: (1) a HoloAnatomy lab using the Microsoft HoloLens; (2) a student-directed seminar using Complete Anatomy and VH Dissector; and (3) a cadaver-based lab using demonstration dissections and the Anatomage Table, a tool for life-sized 3D virtual dissection.

The sub-field seeks to understand how cultures, including our own, organize and structure these activities through institutions, rituals, and beliefs systems. However, unlike the formal approach of the field of economics, the in-depth methods of economic anthropology concentrate on day-to-day experiences of what the economic means, how this is defined, and what we can learn about human behavior through it.This course will introduce students to economic anthropology and some of the major questions and challenges this field addresses. The history of this sub-field, how it relates to economic sociology, and areas where economic anthropology and traditional economics overlap, will also be explored. This class does not present economic anthropology and modern economics as adversaries, instead how and why they are fundamentally different orientations with often seemingly little in common. On this backdrop, this class will survey a number of different topics, including: health commodification; gift exchange; commodity chains; the history of money and debt; why objects have value; how people make ends meet; rational vs. non-rational decision-making; behavioral economic experiments conducted in other cultures; development economics, and why some objects and services have prices while others do not.Offered as ANTH 325 and ANTH 425."

    "description": "The purpose of this course is twofold: It is a course that allows students an in-depth look at the diverse women who represent a number of cultures in the Arab world in nations from the Mashrek to the Maghreb. The second primary goal of the course is to study such women through the eyes of leading Arab women theorists who have made an impact not only in their own countries, but also on disciplines intersecting with women's studies worldwide. We will study the Arab woman's place in her respective society, in political and economic systems, in education, and in the family. We will also analyze her contributions to art and literature as well as to the sciences. The course will provide an overview of the Arab woman throughout history, from her origins to her place within recent movements within the Arab Spring and other current world events. As Arab women are Muslim, Christian, and Jewish, views of women within these major world religions will also be taken into account as we study the Arab woman as well as religion's impact on culture in the Middle East and in the Maghreb in particular. In the course, we will utilize theoretical texts, but also case studies as well as examples from media and the arts. During the semester, we will take advantage of teleconferencing opportunities between CWRU and two major academic units for Women's Studies in the Arab world: The Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World (IWSAW) in Beirut, Lebanon, and the University of Jordan's Center for Women's Studies in Amman.Offered as FRCH 337, FRCH 437, ARAB 337, ETHS 337 and WGST 337.

    "credit hours": "3U",
    "description": "People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of \"pagan\" and \"Christian\" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine \"Christianized\" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a \"pagan\" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.Offered as ARTH 325, ARTH 425 and CLSC 325.

    "description": "Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.Offered as ARTH 336, ARTH 436, CLSC 336 and CLSC 436.

    "description": "This course will explore three distinct but interrelated topics in medieval visual culture, which haunt the modern world as well. We will first study the concepts of the monsters and the monstrous in medieval Europe, as they were manifested in visual, literary, and cryptozoological production. From monster theory to monster culture, we will look at the anxieties that the monsters--those from the edges, those from within--have written on the body of medieval art. These same anxieties, rooted in the fear of difference, manifest themselves in the macabre art: the art of living death that predicated material universe of the late Middle Ages. We will explore the ghosts and the revenants, the living corpses and the nimble skeletons that populate medieval murals, manuscripts, and sculpture. All this is wrapped into the notion of the miraculous, both wondrous and dangerous at once. Here, the focus will be on female bodies, seen as monstrous, macabre, and miraculous at once.

The great art collections of the Renaissance began in much the same way as these playful assemblages. From cabinets of curiosities containing treasures from foreign lands, to paintings of nude women by Titian and Raphael, these early collections marked the beginning of the modern art museum. What do the hoarding tendencies of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), founder of the `Kircherianum--a museum filled with taxidermy animals and mechanical inventions--have in common with Ronald Lauder's recent and widely publicized purchase of a Gustav Klimt painting for $135 million? Famous American art collectors of the 19th & 20th centuries like Henry Clay Frick, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Peggy Guggenheim opened these formerly private realms of display to the public, revealing the complex motives and politics inherent to the practice of art collection. This course will focus first on the conceptual issues that informed early modern collecting inthe western world, and subsequently the way that these ideas and modalities later inflected and shaped the history of modern collecting--particularly in the private sector in Europe and America.Offered as: ARTH 368 and ARTH 468.

    "description": "As issues of sustainability and environmental impact have become increasingly dominant concerns in contemporary society, eco-criticism has emerged as a vital methodological thread across the humanities.  Motivated by ethical as well as scholarly concerns, eco-criticism not only enacts a fundamental examination of nature as an ideological construct, but also seeks to investigate the complex interrelationship between humanity and the environment.  Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of \"green issues\" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.Offered as ARTH 382, ARTH 482 and ESTD 382.

    "credit hours": "3U",
    "description": "People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of \"pagan\" and \"Christian\" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine \"Christianized\" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a \"pagan\" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.Offered as ARTH 325, ARTH 425 and CLSC 325.

    "credit hours": "3U",
    "description": "Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.Offered as ARTH 336, ARTH 436, CLSC 336 and CLSC 436.

We will first study the concepts of the monsters and the monstrous in medieval Europe, as they were manifested in visual, literary, and cryptozoological production. From monster theory to monster culture, we will look at the anxieties that the monsters--those from the edges, those from within--have written on the body of medieval art. These same anxieties, rooted in the fear of difference, manifest themselves in the macabre art: the art of living death that predicated material universe of the late Middle Ages. We will explore the ghosts and the revenants, the living corpses and the nimble skeletons that populate medieval murals, manuscripts, and sculpture. All this is wrapped into the notion of the miraculous, both wondrous and dangerous at once. Here, the focus will be on female bodies, seen as monstrous, macabre, and miraculous at once. Students should be prepared to discuss these topics both within the context of medieval Europe and within our own historical moment.Offered as ARTH 356 and ARTH 456."

The great art collections of the Renaissance began in much the same way as these playful assemblages. From cabinets of curiosities containing treasures from foreign lands, to paintings of nude women by Titian and Raphael, these early collections marked the beginning of the modern art museum. What do the hoarding tendencies of the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), founder of the `Kircherianum--a museum filled with taxidermy animals and mechanical inventions--have in common with Ronald Lauder's recent and widely publicized purchase of a Gustav Klimt painting for $135 million? Famous American art collectors of the 19th & 20th centuries like Henry Clay Frick, Isabella Stewart Gardner, and Peggy Guggenheim opened these formerly private realms of display to the public, revealing the complex motives and politics inherent to the practice of art collection. This course will focus first on the conceptual issues that informed early modern collecting inthe western world, and subsequently the way that these ideas and modalities later inflected and shaped the history of modern collecting--particularly in the private sector in Europe and America.Offered as: ARTH 368 and ARTH 468.

    "description": "As issues of sustainability and environmental impact have become increasingly dominant concerns in contemporary society, eco-criticism has emerged as a vital methodological thread across the humanities.  Motivated by ethical as well as scholarly concerns, eco-criticism not only enacts a fundamental examination of nature as an ideological construct, but also seeks to investigate the complex interrelationship between humanity and the environment.  Concurrently, there has been a marked interest in studying the role of \"green issues\" in contemporary art, particularly in tracing the development of earth art or eco-art from the early 1970s to the present.  The goal of this seminar is to forge a link between these two emergent strands by tracing the complex relationship between art and the environment from the nineteenth-century to the present, seeking to thereby assess the capaciousness of eco-criticism as a methodological approach to art history.Offered as ARTH 382, ARTH 482 and ESTD 382.

Encountering complicated geopolitical and socioeconomic conditions in the post-war era, a series of experimental and radical artistic, cultural, and political movements have emerged in East Asia. The course will map the critical topographies of Asian art from 1945 to the 1980s through the exploration of the following: post-war art and experimental art in Japan and Korea, Chinese art during the Cultural Revolution, material culture in Japanese Mono-ha and Korean Dansaekhwa, and art of resistance in China and Korea in the 1980s. The course will also investigate contemporary Asian art and visual culture focusing on its global turn from the late 1980s. Fueled by international geopolitical change, economic boom, and the impact of globalization, art in Asia or by Asian artists has gained a high level of international visibility and taken a central position in contemporary art exhibitions and art criticism. This visual, social, and theoretical development in the recent art in Asia will be examined through key issues and themes: art's revisiting of tradition and history, its exploration of body and identity, the impact of consumerism and popular culture, and its engagement with public space and the urban environment.Offered as ARTH 397 and ARTH 497.

The culture industries (along with many other sectors) have been forced to re-examine the viability and utility of their current models, and the assumptions these models are predicated upon. Art institutions are in the process of reconciling their complicated and often contradictory relationship with white, sexist, ableist, and classist ideology, in which they have tacitly perpetuated dominant structures and perspectives while rhetorically advocating for reform and radical change. In this course, we will explore this contemporary cultural moment and unravel the seismic changes that have brought uncertainty to the art world. We will speculate potential futures free of racism, sexism, homophobia, ableism, and classism, and the role that art could play within those possible futures. And we will explore alternative models of artmaking with the potential to instigate those futures through a focus on social engagement, community, and radical inclusion.Offered as ARTS 300 and ARTS 400."

Taken together these regions make up the geographic and cultural unit commonly referred to as \"East Asia.\" Over the course of the term, we will investigate the usefulness of this concept of \"East Asia\" by examining its origins as well as the sometimes convergent, sometimes divergent relations between this region and the rest of the world. We will also challenge the stereotype of a monolithic and static East Asia and see to develop a critical understanding of the internal and external forces integrating and dividing this region. We will examine how international diplomatic, commercial, military, religious, and cultural relationships shaped the individual countries as well as their relationships with each other and the world. The course sweeps over large regions of time and space. It aims to put the contemporary discussion of globalization into historical perspective by examining the long-lasting interactions of East Asian countries with each other and the rest of the world. These connections were economic, political, cultural, and psychological. Topics include: global silver and trade flows, warfare and military technology, imperial domination and revolutionary resistance, and the role of historical memory, as in Nanking or Hiroshima. Sources include historical documents, pictures, films, and memoirs.As we move through the course material our goal is not to gain total knowledge of modern East Asia, nor of China, Japan, Korea nor Vietnam.  Rather, by the end of the term you should be able to identify some of the main organizing themes in modern East Asian history and develop a greater understanding of the construction and nature of historical knowledge itself.Offered as HSTY 132 and ASIA 132.

We will explore the major historical transformations (political, economic, social, and cultural) of the last imperial dynasty, the Qing (1644-1911), and develop an understanding of the major social, political, economic, and intellectual cultural forces shaping the formation of modern China.  Contrary to commonly-held ideas in both West and in China that traditional Chinese society was timeless or stagnant, historians now see dramatic and significant changes during this period--to the economy, to gender relations, to religion, and to many other aspects of life.  This course surveys the social, political, economic, and cultural history of this era, with emphasis on recent research.  The main goals of the course will be to acquaint students with the key changes and to show the interplay between economic, social, and cultural changes on the one hand and political developments on the other.  By the end of the semester you should have a good sense of how Chinese society was transformed over the course of the 17th through early 20th centuries.

Beginning with the First Sino-Japanese War (1895), we review the historical development of intellectual discourse, public reaction, and political protest in later Imperial China through the creation of the People's Republic in 1949 forward to contemporary times.  In contrast to the conventional description of China from a Western point of view, this course tries to explain the emergence of modern China in the context of its intellectual, political, and socio-economic transformation as experienced by Chinese in the late 19th and into the 20th century.  By discussing the influence of the West, domestic rebellions, and political radicalism, we examine how the Chinese state and society interacted in search for modernization and reforms, how these reforms were continued during the Republican period, and to what extent historical patterns can be identified in China's present-day development.Offered as ASIA 289 and HSTY 289.

Brazil is the second largest country in the Western Hemisphere and the 7th or 8th largest economy in the world.  There are more people who speak Portuguese in South America than Spanish.  Despite newly discovered oil, enormous natural and human resources, development in Brazil has been uneven with the Northeast remaining the least developed.  The Northeastern state of Bahia ranked 22nd out of 27 states on the UN's Index of Human Development (http://www.pnud.org.br/IDH/DH.aspx# and http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/pt/home/). The State capital, Salvador, ranks 14th out of 20 major metropolitan regions and is one site for this study abroad program.  The second site, the rural town of Uba\u00edra, is ranked 4590 out of 5565 municipalities.  Even with large social inequities and health care disparities, the Brazilian government and society have produced remarkable social policies, have shown a willingness to implement these policies and have the resources to significantly improve the lives of its most impoverished citizens.  Critical basic infrastructure for health and development is water.  Its consumption is essential; it is a mechanism for waste disposal, industry and agriculture are dependent on its supply.  The problem of water quantity and quality are common all human societies (witness the drought in California and the burning Cuyahoga).  Individuals from all walks of life will need to assess issues of water at some time, from doctors, engineers, urban planners, lawyers and politicians.  In Brazil the issues of water are more exposed and easier to examine on different scales than in the U.S.  The problem also resides within a social, health care, and political context that compares well and at the same time contrasts sharply with that of the USA.As a student in this course, you will gain first-hand knowledge of the social and public health challenges regarding water security in Brazil.  Through field experiences in the capital city of Salvador and the rural town of Uba\u00edra, you will immerse yourself in interdisciplinary perspectives on the public health, scientific, political, and bioethical dimensions of water security in Brazil.

Narrative medicine is informed by the theory and practice of reading, writing, telling, and receiving of stories as a clinically empowering practice for anyone engaged (or planning to engage) in the field of healthcare. This course will employ various methods of learning and experiencing narrative, including fundamental skills of close reading and reflective writing and other forms of self-representation. Narrative competence is an important skill that enables a person to \"recognize, absorb, interpret, represent, and be moved by the stories of illness\". Major themes throughout the course will include caregivers' and patients' empowerment, empathy, narrative ethics, testimony, reflexive writing, and illness and medical stories. The course will be conducted in a seminar-type format.  Each session will have readings that relate to the theory of narrative (primarily from the Charon textbook but also from other sources in the Ethics and Humanities professional literature) and related health humanities.  Many of the sessions will also include the application of reflective practice/close reading.  Additional elements will be writing workshops and use of film and visual art as narrative.  The class will meet once weekly for a 3 hour session.

In that time, personal and professional relationships have been developed with branches of the Ministry of Health (Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, the Municipal and State Health Departments), the Federal University of Bahia, and the Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health. Brazil is the second largest country in the Western Hemisphere and the 7th or 8th largest economy in the world.  There are more people who speak Portuguese in South America than Spanish.  Despite newly discovered oil, enormous natural and human resources, development in Brazil has been uneven with the Northeast remaining the least developed.  The Northeastern state of Bahia ranked 22nd out of 27 states on the UN's Index of Human Development (http://www.pnud.org.br/IDH/DH.aspx# and http://www.atlasbrasil.org.br/2013/pt/home/). The State capital, Salvador, ranks 14th out of 20 major metropolitan regions and is one site for this study abroad program.  The second site, the rural town of Uba\u00edra, is ranked 4590 out of 5565 municipalities.  Even with large social inequities and health care disparities, the Brazilian government and society have produced remarkable social policies, have shown a willingness to implement these policies and have the resources to significantly improve the lives of its most impoverished citizens.  Critical basic infrastructure for health and development is water.  Its consumption is essential; it is a mechanism for waste disposal, industry and agriculture are dependent on its supply.  The problem of water quantity and quality are common all human societies (witness the drought in California and the burning Cuyahoga).  Individuals from all walks of life will need to assess issues of water at some time, from doctors, engineers, urban planners, lawyers and politicians.  In Brazil the issues of water are more exposed and easier to examine on different scales than in the U.S.  The problem also resides within a social, health care, and political context that compares well and at the same time contrasts sharply with that of the USA.As a student in this course, you will gain first-hand knowledge of the social and public health challenges regarding water security in Brazil.  Through field experiences in the capital city of Salvador and the rural town of Uba\u00edra, you will immerse yourself in interdisciplinary perspectives on the public health, scientific, political, and bioethical dimensions of water security in Brazil.

Two broad areas, tuberculosis and the Frankenstein myth, will then be discussed covering the period 1800-present. With tuberculosis, fiction, art and music will be examined to understand the changing views of society towards the disease, how society's perception of tuberculosis victims changed, and how this influenced their treatments and research. With Frankenstein, the original novel in its historical context will be examined. Using fiction and film, the transformation of the original story into myth with different connotations and implications will be discussed. Most classes will be extensive discussions coupled with student presentations of assigned materials.Offered as PHRM 340, BETH 440, PHRM 440, and HSTY 440."

Yet clean experimental design and careful analysis let them ask and answer fundamental biological questions and enabled the development of better tools to use the next time around. In just seven decades, biologists have built a toolbox that offers astonishing precision and power, but the logic of biological experimentation hasn't changed. In this course, we will study that underlying logic, and what it lets us do. We will read key papers spanning the development of modern biology, from the most basic working-out of the Central Dogma to recent advances. We will pay particular attention to how well the authors used the tools available, and how successfully they accounted for their shortcomings--if indeed they did. The emphasis of the course will be on classroom discussion. In lieu of exams, students will (1) write brief responses to weekly in-class prompts for understanding, (2) write in-depth proposals for a molecular biology research project, and (3) present their proposals orally to the class. These assignments are designed to check that students are keeping up with weekly discussions and synthesizing what they have learned into a deeper understanding of how we develop questions and construct arguments in biological research.

    "description": "\"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution\"  --  DobzhanskyBiologists have long been fascinated by the diversity of life. Why are there so many species? Why are some of them similar and others divergent? How has evolution shaped ecological interactions, such as disease-host dynamics? The \"tree of life\" describes phylogenetic hypotheses for evolutionary history among species, and modern phylogenetic comparative methods allow us to incorporate the tree of life into statistical analyses. This course will introduce phylogenetic comparative methods, why they are needed to answer many biological questions, how they are conducted, and how they can be used to evaluate hypotheses. These methods can be used for any group of organisms, from humans and their diseases, to plants, animals, or fungi. These methods also can be used to address a broad suite of questions in biology, including biomedical, ecological, evolutionary, developmental, and neuromechanical questions.

    "description": "It behooves today's business leaders to be well acquainted with blockchain technologies and AI (Artificial Intelligence), two seemingly disparate technologies that have the potential to fundamentally disrupt a wide range of businesses.The popularity of blockchain technologies has increased exponentially since the release of bitcoin in 2009. While bitcoins garnered a lot of attention during the initial days, the focus has shifted over time to the underlying technology: blockchain. This wildly innovative technology has made possible tasks that were hitherto deemed implausible: validate ownership in a digital asset, verify the true state of a transaction without relying on a costly intermediary etc. The list of businesses that are impacted by this technology makes for an impressive reading: supply chain, health care, insurance, foreign exchange transfers, real estate, etc.If the emphasis of blockchain technology is on trust, that of Artificial Intelligence is on predictions. Accurate predictions and sound judgements are two critical ingredients of any decision making process. While the jury is still out on whether algorithms can make sound judgements, recent developments in a field called machine learning (and its sub-field, deep learning) have led to dramatic improvements in the accuracy of predictions made by these algorithms. Significantly, this gain in accuracy has been accompanied by a reduction in overall costs. These in turn have spurred the recent interest in AI. Organizations that have enabled AI at the enterprise level appear to be making more informed decisions and innovating new products. In this course, we will unpack these technologies and examine a wide range of relevant business use cases. Our objective is to provide a practical introduction to these key technologies and their business implications. We focus on business perspectives, rather than on the technical dimensions. Fittingly, this course is open to all graduate students of Weatherhead School (MBA and all specialty Masters). Students are not expected to have any specific programming background; however, a basic understanding of statistics is required to better appreciate the discourse on Artificial Intelligence.

    "description": "This is a hands-on course on Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) where the emphasis is not only on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of various AI models but also on building, evaluating, and critiquing A.I. models as they apply to the finance industry. This course begins with an introduction of Machine Learning models; various key ideas such as bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation, regularization techniques are introduced with relevant examples from Finance. The course then proceeds to discuss Artificial Neural Networks and its relevance to Deep Learning. Foundational ideas such as back-propagation are discussed in sufficient detail; we also lay a lot of emphasis on evaluating the performance of all these models. A key objective of this course is help students build cutting-edge A.I. models that are ready for prime time, i.e., real-life applications. Fittingly, we work with several real-life datasets and case studies from banking and finance. We will work with three case studies, each of which span multiple sessions. -In the first case study, students use Machine Learning algorithms to understand how imbalanced datasets are handled in real-life. -In the second study, students use time series data and learn not only about the power of regularization techniques but also to highlight the prominence of A.I. in financial markets. -In the third case study, students learn how to use cutting-edge Deep Learning models to extract sentiments from disparate news sources; these are in turn used to generate trading strategies. By contrasting the effort that goes into and the payoff obtained from Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, students gain an intuitive appreciation of both these classes of models.Offered as BTEC 494 or FNCE 494."

    "description": "Students selected for their strong background or interest in Greek Civilization spend Spring Break in Athens, Greece (thanks to a collaboration between CWRU's Department of Classics and the Athens Centre).  They follow an intensive seven-day itinerary of travel, visiting major monuments and museums including the Acropolis, Delphi, Epidauros, and Aegina.  Two class sessions of instruction in modern Greek help them to interact with people they meet; but the overwhelming emphasis lies on Classical Athens, the historical-cultural setting for the emergence of Western moral philosophy.  The focus of this mini-course is on the figure of Socrates and the agenda of moral philosophy that the Athenian sage established.  Readings from Plato, Aristophanes, and Aristotle.  Via the Socratic method, students will also study Aristotle's Ethics and test the applicability of that foundational text to their own lives. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."

Contemporary society's continuing fascination with putting the ancient world on the big screen is undeniable; and yet the causes underlying this phenomenon are not quite so readily apparent.  In this course we will watch and discuss a number of movies about the ancient world, running the gamut from Hollywood classics such as Ben-Hur and Spartacus to more recent treatments (the aforementioned 300 and Gladiator, for starters), and from the mainstream and conventional (Clash of the Titans, Disney's Hercules) to the far-out and avant-garde (Fellini's Satyricon, anyone?).  As we do so we'll learn quite a bit about the art and economics of film, on one hand, and the ancient world, on the other.  And yet what we'll keep coming back to are the big questions: what does our fascination with the ancient Mediterranean tell us about ourselves as a society?  Why do such movies get made, and what kinds of agendas do they serve?  To what extent can we recapture the past accurately?  And if we can't, are we doomed to just endlessly projecting our own concerns and desires onto a screen, and dressing them in togas?

    "name": "Art at the Crossroads of Religion: Polytheistic, Christian, and Islamic Art in Antiquity",
    "credit hours": "3U",
    "description": "People often single out the reign of Constantine (A.D. 306-337) as the point in history when Rome transformed from a polytheistic empire to a Christian empire. This course questions the strict divide between the categories of \"pagan\" and \"Christian\" in Rome in the imperial period and beyond. Through a close examination of the artistic and architectural record, students will come to understand that this dichotomy is a modern invention; for people living in the Roman Empire, religious identities were extraordinarily fluid. Indeed, traditional polytheistic religion and Christianity remained closely intertwined for centuries after Constantine \"Christianized\" the Empire. Moreover, religious pluralism had been a fundamental part of Roman culture since the founding of ancient Rome. We will survey a range of material culture, including public statuary, sarcophagi, silver hordes, and temples and churches. We will also examine sites such as the border city of Dura-Europos in Syria to explore how religious identities in the Roman Empire (including Judaism, early Christianity, and so-called mystery cults) intertwined even when Rome was still supposedly a \"pagan\" Empire. The course pays particular attention to the art and architecture produced under Constantine, whom people today often remember as Rome's first Christian emperor but who represents, in fact, a complex amalgam of polytheistic and monotheistic practices and identities. We will also explore how Christian art slowly but ultimately became the predominant visual culture in the Roman Empire. Finally, we will examine how Early Islamic art and architecture exploited the Greco-Roman visual tradition to the ends of this new religion.Offered as ARTH 325, ARTH 425 and CLSC 325.

The course constitutes a mix of museum and site visits to expose us to the artifacts that help us interpret the Roman world, including art and other types of material culture, and the monumental architecture dominating much of Rome to this day. We will also explore important sites outside of the city, including Rome's remarkably well-preserved port at Ostia, the Emperor Hadrian's magnificent villa at Tivoli, and an optional visit to Pompeii and Herculaneum during an extended weekend.Some of the questions we will be asking when visiting the sites include: How did the expansion of the Roman Empire influence the stylistic repertories of the capital's artists and architects? How did the changing political environment shape the topography of the city from Republic to Empire? How can we read political messages and propaganda in the ancient structures? How did (and does) Rome live among, use, and reuse ancient remains?Students will be expected to be active participants in the daily tours.

This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.Offered as ARTH 336, ARTH 436, CLSC 336 and CLSC 436.

The course constitutes a mix of museum and site visits to expose us to the artifacts that help us interpret the Roman world, including art and other types of material culture, and the monumental architecture dominating much of Rome to this day. We will also explore important sites outside of the city, including Rome's remarkably well-preserved port at Ostia, the Emperor Hadrian's magnificent villa at Tivoli, and an optional visit to Pompeii and Herculaneum during an extended weekend.Some of the questions we will be asking when visiting the sites include: How did the expansion of the Roman Empire influence the stylistic repertories of the capital's artists and architects? How did the changing political environment shape the topography of the city from Republic to Empire? How can we read political messages and propaganda in the ancient structures? How did (and does) Rome live among, use, and reuse ancient remains?Students will be expected to be active participants in the daily tours. All students will be presenting on various structures as we come to them (topics to be assigned in advance of the trip). Graduate students are responsible for leading a day tour (with my assistance) - to create the itinerary and develop the thematic framework. Grades will be based on participation on site, presentations, and a paper.  Offered as CLSC 326 and CLSC 426. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."

    "credit hours": "3U",
    "description": "Few societies in history have been as militaristic as ancient Rome--or as proud of their warrior culture. This course examines the many ways that Romans constructed and contested their conceptions of war from the founding of the Roman Republic in 509 B.C.E. to the reign of Constantine (306-337 C.E.). Why did Romans choose to represent war in certain ways, and how did these artistic representations shape Romans' military values? What can the visual record tell us about how different groups (soldiers, women, slaves) experienced war in the Roman world? We will explore major public monuments in the city of Rome (including triumphal arches and the Colosseum) and private objects (such as silver drinking vessels) to observe how Roman militarism pervaded different walks of life. We will also examine monuments on the edges of Rome's empire, such as the towering trophies in modern France and Romania, to explore how works of art and architecture mediated the relationship between Romans and the peoples they conquered. Students will be encouraged to think about how art and architecture contributed to the construction of militarism as a chief Roman value, but also about how visual representations provided an important means to debate the value of Rome's military efforts, to subvert Rome's rigidly hierarchical social order, and to grapple with what it meant to \"be Roman\" as wars transformed Rome from a small city in Italy to a massive, pan-Mediterranean empire. After exploring Romans' conceptions of war and victory, students also may ask whether the common comparison between the Roman Empire and modern America is appropriate.Offered as ARTH 336, ARTH 436, CLSC 336 and CLSC 436.

    "description": "Urbanism is design; architecture is design; of course, the aesthetic shaping of artifacts (such as computers, cars, and coffee machines) is design.  Configuring surfaces, volumes, and portions of space in special ways, creating and changing formats for things and places that allow cultural practices to unfold while delimiting them, are essential 'designing\" endeavors of human civilization and are, necessarily, activities based on the cognitive capacities and constraints of our species.  We 'cognize' the human world in terms and frames of 'designed' surroundings.  Design is a basic expressive activity, by which we interact with our artificial and natural surroundings and create 'interfaces' between mind and reality, thus upholding and interpretable world.  Landscapes and cityscapes, work spaces of all sorts, buildings and parks, exteriors and interiors of homes, factories, institutions, and temples; furniture, artifacts such as machines, tools, weapons, symbolic objects, even the configuration ('building') of our own bodies, are design.  An inquiry into cultural cognition, aiming to understand how humans as socio-cultural beings think and feel, therefore needs to explore this dimension of spatial expressivity and to acknowledge it as a constitutive fact of human meaning production; it needs to study the aesthetic and pragmatic, political and historical, philosophical and religious, and simply everyday practical, semiotic aspects of this basic form of human creativity.  This course will focus on spatial expressivity--design--in several primary keys and scales, including design for learning; design for verbal and technical communication, interaction, and commerce; design for expressions of authority and deliberation; and design for emotional display."

Bedrock moral concepts like free will, rights, and moral agency also have been questioned.  In light of such critiques, how can we best understand moral philosophy and religious ethics?  Is ethics primarily informed by nature or by culture?  Or is ethics informed by both?  This course examines 1) ways in which cognitive science--and related fields such as evolutionary biology--impact traditional moral perspectives, and 2) how the study of moral philosophy and comparative ethics forces reconsideration of broad cognitive science theories about the nature of ethics.  The course examines the concept of free will as a case study in applying these interpretive viewpoints.  Interdisciplinary readings include literature from moral philosophy, religious ethics, cognitive science, and evolutionary biology.  Offered as COGS 272 and RLGN 272."

In recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. It is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. Such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.This course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).By term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience.

SLA seeks to understand the linguistic, psychological and social processes that underlie the learning and use of second language(s). The goal of research is to identify the principles and processes that govern second language learning and use. SLA is approached from three perspectives in the course:  1) as linguistic knowledge;2) as a cognitive skill; and 3) as a socially and personality-meditated process. Important factors in second language learning will be identified and discussed. These include: age-related differences, the influence of the first language, the role played by innate (universal) principles, the role of memory processes, attitudes, motivation, personality and cognitive styles, and formal versus naturalistic learning contexts. The objective of this course is to survey the principal research in second language acquisition.

Topics covered will include: the role of input (listening/reading) vs. output (speaking/writing); implicit vs. explicit learning; negative vs. positive evidence (including the role of error correction); affective factors (motivation, anxiety); individual differences; teachability hypothesis and syllabus construction, program design/evaluation, language testing, among others.The purpose of this course is to survey the principal research in the acquisition of second language that is relevant to second language teaching in a classroom setting, and to obtain the state-of-the-art knowledge of the SLA research literature that is relevant to L2 teaching.  The focus is not necessarily on the practical application of the SLA research, although we will not exclude discussion of classroom application.  Rather, we critically examine and evaluate SLA research and come up with our own syntheses with respect to various issues.  To achieve this goal, we should ask following questions in reading and discussing the relevant literature:  1) What are the main claims that the author(s) make(s)?  2) Are the author's claims sound?  If not why?  3) What further research is needed to answer remaining questions?Students will become familiar with the major research issues through their reading of both primary and secondary sources, as well as through lectures and class discussions.

Others with an interest in the intersection of Buddhism and cognitive science, such as Robert Wright in Why Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment (2017), argue that non-supernatural aspects of Buddhism, such as the benefits of mindfulness meditation and the nature of the (non-)self, are affirmed by cognitive science and evolutionary psychology. The notion that at least some aspects of Buddhism are \"true\" in relation to contemporary cognitive scientific views of mind and brain has attracted considerable attention from both Buddhist practitioners and cognitive scientists.This seminar explores Buddhist and cognitive science perspectives on issues such as embodied cognition, consciousness, mind, self and personal identity, theory of mind, morality, representation, and language. We start with a general overview of Buddhist philosophy, and then turn to specific readings on Buddhist concepts in relation to similar concepts found in the cognitive science literature.

In recent years, the role of culture and cultural diversity has come to play a significant role in thinking about social cognition and the evolution of sociality. It is likewise an unfortunate fact that many human beings lack many of the means, abilities, and dispositions to connect with one another easily and without extensive and explicit tutelage. Such clinical populations (e.g., autistics, schizophrenics, etc.) are of considerable interest because of their promise as a contrastive model of typicality.This course will focus on these aspects of sociality both at the level of the interpersonal and personal (cognitive and phenomenological) and the sub-personal (neuronscientific).By term's end, students in this class will develop a deep understanding of several dimensions of social cognition research and its implications for the next generation of cognitive neuroscience.

Important factors in second language learning will be identified and discussed. These include: age-related differences, the influence of the first language, the role played by innate (universal) principles, the role of memory processes, attitudes, motivation, personality and cognitive styles, and formal versus naturalistic learning contexts.

The focus is not necessarily on the practical application of the SLA research, although we will not exclude discussion of classroom application.  Rather, we critically examine and evaluate SLA research and come up with our own syntheses with respect to various issues.  To achieve this goal, we should ask following questions in reading and discussing the relevant literature:  1) What are the main claims that the author(s) make(s)?  2) Are the author's claims sound?  If not why?  3) What further research is needed to answer remaining questions?Students will become familiar with the major research issues through their reading of both primary and secondary sources, as well as through lectures and class discussions.

We consider such ideas as conceptual metaphor theory, conceptual blending, Image schemas, cross-domain mappings, metonymy, mental spaces, and idealized cognitive models.  We apply these ideas to selected Christian, Buddhist, and Chinese religious texts in order to understand ways in which religious language categorizes and conceptualizes the world.  We examine both the universality of cognitive linguistic processes and the culturally specific metaphors, conceptual blends, image schemas, and other cognitive operations that particular texts and traditions utilize.Offered as RLGN 352, RLGN 452, COGS 352 and COGS 452.

    "name": "Meta-Analysis & Evidence Synthesis",
    "credit hours": "2-3",
    "description": "Systematic reviews use reproducible methods to systematically search the literature and synthesize the results of a specific topic area. Meta-analysis is a specific analytic technique used to pool results of individual studies. Systematic reviews are useful ways to establish one's knowledge in a particular field of study, and can highlight gaps in research which can be pursued in future work. They can also inform the background of a grant. This course is designed to introduce students to the methods of conducting a high quality systematic review and meta-analysis of intervention studies. We will cover the design, methods, and analytic techniques involved in systematic reviews. These concepts will prepare students to conduct their own systematic review or evaluate the systematic reviews of others. Sessions will be lectures, labs, and presentations.  Topics include developing a search strategy, abstracting key data, synthesizing the results qualitatively, meta-analytic techniques, grading the quality of studies, grading the strength of the evidence, and manuscript preparation specific to systematic reviews and meta-analysis of intervention studies.  Caveat:If you would like to conduct a systematic review of your own that can be published after the course ends, you will need to have several other class members or colleagues willing to work with you on the project. The systematic review should be on a topic where you expect no more than 20-30 included studies in order to be able to complete the review soon after the course ends.Offered as CRSP 550 and PQHS 550.Prereq: CRSP 401, PQHS/EPBI 431, MPHP 405, NURS 532 or Requisites Not Met permission."

    "description": "This course introduces key concepts and techniques for characterizing, from observational or experimental study data and from background information, the causal effect of a specific treatment, exposure, or intervention (e.g., a medical treatment) upon an outcome of interest (e.g., disease status). The fundamental problem of causal inference is the impossibility of observing the effects of different and incompatible treatments on the same individual or unit.  This problem is overcome by estimating an average causal effect over a study population.  Making valid causal inferences with observational data is especially challenging, because of the greater potential for biases (confounding bias, selection bias, and measurement bias) that can badly distort causal effect estimates.  Consequently, this topic has been the focus of intense cross-disciplinary research in recent years.  Causal inference techniques will be illustrated by applications in several fields such as computer science, engineering, medicine, public health, biology, genomics, neuroscience, economics, and social science.  Course grading will be based on quizzes, homeworks, a class presentation, and a causal data analysis project.Specific topics: treatments, exposures, and interventions; causal effects and causal effect measures; confounding bias; potential outcomes and counterfactuals; randomized experiments; observational studies; causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); exchangeability and conditional exchangeability; effect modification; causal interactions; nonparametric structural equations; Pearl's Back-Door Criterion, Front-Door Criterion, and related results; covariate adjustment; matching on covariates; selection bias; measurement bias; instrumental variables; causal modeling; inverse probability weighting; marginal structural models; standardization; structural nested models; outcome regression; propensity scores; sensitivity analysis.Prereq: CSDS 440 or MATH 380 or STAT 312 or STAT 313 or STAT 332 or STAT 333 or Requisites Not Met permission."

The three basic questions that all entrepreneurs and intrepreneurs must answer is where to play, how to win and what to do.  You have identified a group of customers for your product or service (where to play).  Your first challenge is to know what features (Customer Attributes) your target customer will pay for. Innovative business models focus on a set of customer attributes that are usually very different from other industry incumbents that we call Focal Attributes. Your second challenge is to clearly state your profit logic -- how you will make money -- how to win.  The concept called Profit Objectives (similar but not the same as KPI and/or SMART objectives) allow you to operationalize the profit logic through specific and measurable deliverables.   Your third challenge is building the value chain that can deliver these focal attributes (what to do).  At this point, you have a good understanding of all the elements of your business model and in particular, how the focal attributes and the value chain align with the profit objectives. You will learn how to illustrate this alignment through a mapping process.Offered as DESN 308 and ENTP 308.Prereq: Junior standing or higher."

    "description": "A new wave of digital revolution is transforming every industrial sector. Powered by increasingly smaller yet potent microprocessors and sensors, a new generation of analytical tools, and ubiquitous wearable and mobile devices, companies can radically transform the way they interact with users and the way they create and capture value. Technology like Block Chain and AI are likely to fundamentally reshape how we think about firms and industries. Such changes make existing strategic frameworks and tools obsolete. In order to understand how and why digital technology changes the industrial landscape, companies must understand some of the fundamental characteristics of digital technology and how it demands new types of value creation logic. Be it a large corporation or a small start-up; or a government agency or a multinational enterprise; everyone is struggling to deal with the new digital reality. Yet, exactly how to use digital technology to create value is not clear. While all companies must understand how digital technology is fundamentally different from other forms of technology, ironically digital innovation is not about technology. Digital innovation is making digital technology meaningful and value to users. Therefore, digital innovation requires us to truly understand us (people), what we do, why we do what we do, what makes us happy, and what we consider meaningful. Therefore, digital innovation is a deeply humanistic exploration to make digital technology meaningful and valuable to us. In order to fully harness the transformative capacity of digital technology, we must gain deeper insights on people and their actions, meanings and values. In this experiential course, we use design as the primary tool to gain such humanistic insights, and work with real-world projects to apply those ideas and tools to build real digital innovations."

An important goal of macroeconomic researchers is to develop a model of an economy that is simple, yet powerful enough to explain the historical trends of these aggregate economic indicators. Needless to say, coming up with a good model has remained a very difficult task. So far, there is no single model that is good enough to coherently explain even the most prominent historical trends of aggregate economic indicators. But several models have been built, each offering insight into a certain aspect of the economy.

These data are usually gathered by observing actual economies, firms and consumers, rather than by performing experiments in a laboratory. Because field data does not have the precision and control of laboratory data, analysts must compensate by adjusting their statistical procedures. In this class, we will concentrate on regression analysis, which is the basic tool of the economic researcher. We will study the assumptions commonly made in the application of this technique, the consequences of violating these assumptions, and the corrections that can be made.

The course focuses on the roles of information, property rights, and incentives in determining the origin and performance of different types of organizations. We look at problems faced by real organizations, examining questions such as, are Facebook and Uber fundamentally new types of firms? Why do some firms offer high-paying jobs while competitors in the same industry do not (eg, Costco vs. Wal-mart)?  What are the impacts of different kinds of contracts with workers and supply chain firms on incentives to work hard, invest, and innovate? Should firms maximize shareholder value, or something else? Why are firms often not able to survive \"disruptive innovation\"? Are venture capitalists promoters or thwarters of innovation?

The goal of this course is to develop the economic tools for understanding and evaluating a wide range of government behaviors such as taxation and redistribution policy, the public provision of goods and services, and the regulation of private markets. ECON 342 begins by considering \"market failures\" that justify government intervention in a market economy. To respond to such failures, governments must raise revenues through taxation. Using the tools of microeconomic theory, we will develop a framework for thinking about the positive and normative effects of alternative forms of taxation. Particular attention will be paid to the individual income tax in the U.S., allowing students to understand the efficiency, distributional and behavioral implications of recent changes in the tax code. We will then turn to the expenditure side of the public sector. The economic principles used to evaluate public expenditures will be discussed and exemplified through the analysis of significant public programs.

While the popularity of sports is unquestioned, there are many ways in which economics can delve more deeply into the hidden inner-workings of the sports world. When sports teams acquire a new player, are they attempting to maximize wins, or profits? Do the NCAA, NFL, or other sports leagues have a monopoly, and what costs would this entail? What incentives guide sports teams, strategies, and would they ever lose on purpose? Is it worth it to subsidize a sports team to build a new stadium, or renovate an existing arena, in your city? The purpose of this course is to perform economic analysis of sports teams, leagues, and institutions by applying economic tools to a variety of sport-related topics.

The term \"developing country\" is often defined as a country that exhibits low per capita income, high poverty level, low level of industrialization, or low life expectancy. In terms of size, the developing countries make up at least three-fourth of the world population. Why do we study those countries' economies separately from the industrialized economies? In fact, low economic growth, high unemployment, or high poverty rates also exist in many developed countries. The differences lie not in the types of problems but in the causes of these problems. In addition, differences in the kind of institutions that prevail in developing countries also lead to different policy prescriptions. Among developing countries, differences in historical experience, cultural practices, political institutions and economic conditions are also enormous. Illustrations and explanations of those differences are provided from a wide range of developing countries.Prereq: ECON 102."

    "description": "Healthcare accounts for over one-sixth of the U.S. national economy and over one-eighth of its workforce, shares that have dramatically increased over the last 50 years. The rapid growth in healthcare spending has accompanied growing concerns about the quality and efficiency of U.S. healthcare delivery and persistent disparities in access to care. Are these concerns justified? If so, what can policymakers do - and what are they doing - to address them? The purpose of this course is to develop the analytical skills necessary for understanding how the U.S. health care sector operates, how it has evolved, the forces at work behind perceived deficiencies (in access, quality and cost control), and the expected impact of alternative policy proposals. These issues are addressed through the lens of microeconomic theory. Under this framework, outcomes result from the interaction of decisions made by participants in the healthcare economy (e.g. patients, providers, insurers, government), with those decisions governed by the preferences, incentives and resource constraints facing each decision-maker. This course should be of particular interest to students who envision future careers in healthcare delivery, healthcare management, pharmaceutical and device innovation, health insurance or public health, as well as other policy-oriented students seeking to understand the contentious issues in healthcare policymaking.Prereq: ECON 102."

In particular, the course will help the participants to understand the following:-Corporate development strategy through capabilities and leveragable capabilities-Before venturing into a new business, the firm has to have a clear understanding of the critical capabilities required for success in the new business.-Firms can increase the odds of success if they can leverage  (parts of ) existing capabilities to new businesses.-Corporate development strategies-adapting to a market-Analyze the industry environment in order to select the competitive battlefield to increase the odds of success by leveraging some of your existing capabilities - sometimes also known as core competencies.  This is a relatively low risk strategy.  We will develop methodologies that will allow you to identify markets (segments) where your current capabilities are leveragable.-Shaping a market usually requires developing a completely new set of capabilities - very risky.  We will develop concepts to understand techniques to mitigate these risks.-Acquisitions as one of the means for corporate development-Approximately half of the class sessions will be devoted to the specific case of acquisitions as a means to expand the boundaries of a firm.  We will explore both how acquisitions contribute to competitive advantage and the selection process and integration of the acquired entity.  Less emphasis will be placed on strict financial valuations and negotiations.Prereq: E.M.B.A. candidates only."

    "name": "Managing Risk and Real Options.  2",
    "credit hours": "5U",
    "description": "The course seeks to help corporate managers understand how financial design can be used to advance the goals and strategies of the firm.  In the Finance course, you concentrated almost exclusively on the firm's capital expenditure decision.  You studied in great detail the discounted cash flow model, NPV, how you get your cash flows, and how you discount according to risk.  Now we move to the other side of the balance sheet to look at how the firm can finance these expenditures.  The first part of this class provides the basic building blocks of financial engineering which begins with call and put options.  The course focuses on using derivatives (calls and puts) to change a firm's risk profile with respect to equity, interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, and commodity risks.  We look at capital structure decisions and securitization issues and discuss what it means to create optimal structures.  Almost immediately we will tie this to our financial crisis and obtain an appreciation for financial designs that could be setup so as to enhance firm value, mitigate systemic risks, or accomplish specific sustainable goals in a global economy.  The second part of the class is geared towards real options and its relationship to strategic planning. In competitive markets, no one expects to formulate a detailed long-term plan and follow it mindlessly.  As soon as we start down the path, we begin learning about business conditions, competitors' actions, and so forth and we need to respond flexibly to what we learn.  Unfortunately, the financial tool most widely relied on to estimate the value of strategy, DCF, assumes that we follow a predetermined plan, regardless of how events unfold.  A better approach to valuation would incorporate both the uncertainty inherent in business and the active decision making required for strategy to succeed.Prereq: E.M.B.A. candidates only."

    "description": "In most companies the process of designing business models is an ad hoc process and in my opinion an inefficient process.  In this course you will learn a systematic but iterative process to do this.  We will expose you to some broad categories of business models and internalize the basic logic of how to make money in each of these categories.  The first step is to recognize which of these categories is most applicable to your business.  The second step is to customize these broad patterns to the specifics of the business at hand.  This seems easy because everything is in English and there are no hard formulas to figure out.  However, unless you discipline yourself to systematically go through a structured process (there are other equally valid processes than the ones you'll be exposed to) it is very easy to fall into the ad hoc trap.You will internalize this process by applying it over a wide range of business situations that will give you confidence in its applicability to any business opportunity.  After the completion of this course you should be quickly able to draw the outline of a business model for any business opportunity that you're considering.Prereq: E.M.B.A. candidates only."

    "description": "A utopia is a dream of a better world; a dystopia is a nightmare of a worse one. Both are fantasies. Yet both respond to the very real technological, political and cultural conditions in which they are written. This multidisciplinary course uses utopian and dystopian literature from the sixteenth century to the present to investigate the rise of scientific modernity and the responses it provoked. Starting with Thomas More's Utopia, and ending with Octavia Butler's The Parable of the Sower and a contemporary film, students will read important utopian and dystopian works of fiction and connect them to themes that run through the history of science: the relationship between knowledge and power; the impact of new technologies; voyages of exploration and exploitation; industrialization and forms of production; ideas of gender, race, and class; nuclear power; genetics; and climate change. We encourage students to ask what led to these specific critiques or ideas, and why? What limits or determines the boundaries of the possible or the desirable to each author? And how might these still be relevant today?Offered as ENGL 145 and HSTY 145. Counts for CAS Global & Cultural Diversity Requirement."

    "description": "Industry today is looking for someone who can develop data science solutions using open source tools and technologies. The languages such as \"R\" and \"Python\" play a significant role facilitating the building of statistical and data science models and approaches to visualize data and making predictions to support decisions. The languages are taught from basics such as objects, data types, functions, control structures, etc., that are essential to read and manipulate a lot of structured data. Some of the basic skills like data acquisition, analysis, dealing with inconsistencies within the data and cleansing, transforming the data as required for further modeling and several other traits to prepare the data will be taught. It is also a common practice to begin the data analysis by visualizing the data in addition to computing summary descriptive statistics.  Well-designed visualization techniques can decrease cognitive workload, provide simpler perceptual inferences and improve comprehension of large sets of data to facilitate decision making.  Techniques and algorithms for creating effective visualizations will be covered along with the required basics of R, Python and Tableau to generate descriptive statistics, run experiments and draw inferences, visualize the data and present a data story."
